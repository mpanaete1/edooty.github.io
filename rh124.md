### Input Output Redirection and Chaining Operators

<a href="rh124.html">Top</a>

| Command Example                               | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `cat example.txt > example_output.txt`        | `>`  is used for ouput (STDOUT ID-1) redirection. the output of example.txt will be put in a new file called example_output.txt (overwriting if example_output.txt existed) |
| `cat example.txt >> example_output.txt`       | `>>` used to append/add output to the end of a file instead of overwriting. |
| `mail -s "subject" test@email.com < file.txt` | `<` is used for input (STDIN ID-0) redirection. This would attach file.txt to the email and sent to the email address |
| `find / *.txt 2>/dev/null`                    | `2>` is used for standard error (STDERR ID-2). If the find command returns errors it will dump them to `/dev/null` (bit bucket). You can also send errors to any file such as error.log |
| `<command> &`                                 | `&` send a command to run in the background. use `jobs` to see what is running,. `fg %(job number)` to bring it to the foreground, `CTRL + Z` to pause job |
| `mkdir test;cd test;touch file.txt`           | `;` makes it possilbe to run several commands sequentially   |
| `ping -c2 <ip> && ssh root@<IP>`              | `&&` this would execute the 2nd command (SSH) only if the first command is successful |
| semanage`||` getenforce                       | `||` (OR operator) similar to else statement. execute second command only if the first command fails |
| `cat file.txt | grep ^#`                      | `|` Pipe operator. the first command acts as input to the second command. |

### Setting User Configurations

<a href="rh124.html">Top</a>

#### Allow a User to Use SUDO to Run Any Command

```
touch /etc/sudoer.d/<username>
vim /etc/sudoers.d/<username>
	<username> ALL=(ALL) ALL
```



#### SSH Keys/Config

##### Generate ssh keys for a user

`ssh-keygen` you can set password for the keys as well as specify name .ssh/<name>

##### Copy newly created ssh keys to a remote host for key authentication

`ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/<pub key> user@remoteLocation`

​	test (should not ask for a password)   `ssh -i .ssh/<private key> user@remoteLocation`

##### Copy to remote host using ssh keys

`scp -i .ssh/<private key> <local file> user@remoteLocation:<remote transfer location>`

​	*note: you dont need the -i to copy to a remote location using password

##### Prevent users from logging in with ssh as root

```
sudo vim /etc/ssh/ssh_config 
	AllowRootLogin = no

#Restart the ssh service
sudo systemctl reload ssh
```

##### Force users to use their ssh keys instead of using a password to login

```
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	PasswordAuthenitcation = no
```



#### Set Default Umask

```
login/ssh/su -    as the user you want to set default umask on
echo "umask ###" >> .bash_profile     (### octal format. See Basic Linux)
echo "umask ###" >> .bashrc			  (### octal format)
```

##### Calculating Umask Values

system default = <u>777 for folders</u> and <u>666 for files</u>

if you want to set a file permission to 664 (user (rw), group (rw), and other (r))

​	666 - 664 = 002 umask

| Mask Numeric Value | Symbolic | Value                    |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------------------ |
| 0                  | `---`    | No permission            |
| 1                  | `--x`    | Execute                  |
| 2                  | `-w-`    | Write                    |
| 3                  | `-wx`    | Write and execute        |
| 4                  | `r--`    | Read                     |
| 5                  | `r-x`    | Read and execute         |
| 6                  | `rw-`    | Read and write           |
| 7                  | `rwx`    | Read, write, and execute |
