### Understand core components of Ansible

#### Inventories

Inventories define a collection of hosts that ansible will manage. 

| Commands                                | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ansible all --list-hosts`              | list all hosts/groups in inventory (-i to specify inventory) |
| `ansible web1.example.com --list-hosts` | verify machine presence                                      |
| `ansible <groupname> --list-hosts`      | list all hosts in a group                                    |
| `ansible ungrouped --list-hosts`        | show all ungrouped hosts in inventory                        |

- list of host names or IP addresses on a single line. you can define groups, nested groups, and variables

- group names are in square brackets [ ] and you can specify ip or hostnames.  you can have multiple ips/hostnames in more than 1 group
- nested groups are in square brackets [all:children] with :children
- ranges are specified with [START:END]. make sure to use 01 or 1 for exact matching		

```
192.168.1.5

[webservers]  
web1.example.com	
192.168.1.3	
host8

[us]
192.168.3.4
host8

[all:children]
us
webservers

192.168.[4:7].[0:255]
server[01:10].server.com
[a:h].dns.server.com
```

#### Modules

<a href="ex294.html">Top</a>

Modules (`-m`) are small programs that are executed to implement tasks

| Modules             | Description                                                  |

#### Variables

<a href="ex294.html">Top</a>

variables can be used to store values that can then be used througout file in a Ansible project. 

start variables with letters and user underscores, no spaces.

variables can be defined in three basic concepts

 - global scope: variables set from the command line or Ansible config
 - play scope: set in the play and related structures
 - host scope: set on host groups and indivdual hosts by the inventory

```
---
- hosts: all						(Place a variable in a vars block in the beggining)
  vars:
  	user: joe
  	home: /home/joe
  	
- hosts: all						(define variables in an external file)
  var_file: 
  	- vars/users.yml

vars:								(Variable in a playbook)
	user: joe
	
tasks:
	- name: Creates the user {{ user }}
	  user:
	  	name: "{{ user }}"
	 
#Inventory Variables

[servers]									(define var for host variable)
server.example.com ansible_user=joe


[servers]									(define user group for the servers host group)
host1.example.com
host2.example.com

[servers:vars]								
user=joe
```

#### Facts

<a href="ex294.html">Top</a>

Vairables that are automatically discovered by ansible on the managed hosts. 

host-specific information. A way of getting the state of managed hosts and to determine what action to take based on that state.

`ansible_facts`  is setup with the ansible setup command `ansible <host> -m setup > ansible_facts`

​	`ansible_facts` has information on the hosts you run the `-m` on.

​	format: `{{ ansible_facts['<name>'] }}`	  

​	disable fact gathering  `gather_facts: no`

```
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
	- name: Prints various Ansible facts
	  debug:
		msg: >
			The default IPv4 address of {{ ansible_facts['fqdn'] }}
			is {{ ansible_facts['default_ipv4.address']['address'] }}
```

##### Custom Facts

custom facts you can put on remote hosts

config file `/etc/ansible/facts.d`

fact files end in `.fact` and need to be in `/etc/ansible/facts.d/` directory on the remote host and must be executable.

<u>Example:</u>

```
[general]						(/etc/ansible/facts.d/custom.facts file on remote host)
package = httpd
service = httpd
state = started
enabled = true
```

```
"{{ ansible_facts['ansible_local']['custom']['general']['package'] }}      (in playbook) 
```

#### Plays

a play is an ordered set of tasks to run against hosts or series of items (see playbook example below)

#### Playbooks

<a href="ex294.html">Top</a>

Playbooks are used to run multiple, complex tasks against a set of targeted hosts

a playbook is a text file containing a list of one or more plays to run in a specific order

```
---												(start of the playbook)
- name: Configure important user consistently	(defined lists, start with a -)	
  hosts: web1.example.com						(remote host/s to run tasks on (key))
  tasks:										(task list/ or single task (key))	
 	- name: newbie exists with UUID 4000		(name for your task. (list item))
 	  user:										(module to use for task)
 	  	name: newbie							(Options for the user module)
 	  	uid: 4000								(Options for the user module)
 	  	state: present							(Options for the user module)
 	  	
 	- name: httpd is installed					(second task name (list item))
 	  yum:										(module)	
 	  	name: httpd								(Options for the yum module)
 	  	state: present							(Options for the yum module)
 	  	
 	- name: web server is enabled				(antother task to check httpd)
 	  service:									(service module)
 	    name: httpd								(module options)
 	    enabled: true							(module options)
 	    
- name: Second Play								(multiple plays)
  hosts: web.example.com						
  remote_user: automation						(adding user attributes option)
  become: yes									(adding privilege escaltaion option)
  tasks: 
  	- name: first task
  	  service:
  	  	name: mariadb
  	  	enabled: true
	
	- name: latest version of packages
	  yum:
	  	name:
	  		- firewalld							(having multiple names in list)
	  		- httpd
  			- php
```

apply settings to vim (`~/.vimrc`) to make it easier to edit playbooks

​		`set number`

​		`syntax on`

​		`autocmd FileType yaml setlocal ai ts=2 sw=2 et cuc cc=3,5,7,9,11`

​		`hi ColorColumn ctermbg=black`

##### Running Playbooks

| Command                                      | Definition                |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `ansible-playbook --syntax-check <name.yml>` | check syntax verification |
| `ansible-playbook -C <name.yml>`             | perform a dry run         |
| `ansible-playbook <name.yml>`                | run a playbook            |

#### Configuration files **(see creating static and configuration files below)**

<a href="ex294.html">Top</a>

#### Use provided documentation to look up specific information about Ansible modules and commands

Get familiar with the documentation : https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/index.html#



### Install and configure an Ansible control node

#### Install required packages

Ansible software only needs to be installed on the control node. Control node should be linux or unix. Windows is not supported. need Python3 or Python2

##### Pre-requisites

`yum list installed platform-python`

`subscription-manager repos --enable ansible-2-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms`

`subscription-manager refresh`

##### Install

`yum install ansible`

​	`ansible --version`

verify python version on host : `ansible -m setup localhost | grep ansible_python_version`

##### Managed Host requirements

​	Python 2.6 ^ or Python 3

​	specific modules may need newer python versions

​	`yum module install python36

#### Create a static host inventory file

Inventories are a collection of hosts that Ansible will manage. There are two types:

​	**static**- defined by a text file

​	**dynamic**- generated by a script, using external information providers

<u>default location</u>: `/etc/ansible/hosts`

​				you can create one in your own directory

#### Create a configuration file

<a href="ex294.html">Top</a>

| Location                            | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`          | provided by the ansible package as a base config. This file is used if no other config file is found |
| `~/.ansible.cfg`                    | ansible looks for this file in users home directory. used instead of /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg and there is no ansible.cfg in the currently working directory |
| `./ansible.cfg`                     | if this file exists in the current working directory it is used instead of the global or users personal file. <u>This is best practice</u> |
| ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable | Ansible uses the config set in the environment variable instead of searching above locations. |

check config file : `ansible all --list-hosts -v`  config file used is at the top of output `-v`

<u>Configuration File Example:</u>

```
[defaults]                  	(make sure you use DEFAULTS not DEFAULT)
inventory = ./inventory     	(specify inventory file)
remote_user = <user>        	(what user is connecting to remote host)
ask_pass = true/false       	(ask for a password (sshkeys) or configure sudo/ssh) 

[privilege_escalation]      	(learn how to spell privilege)
become = true/false				(will your remote connection/cmds escalate privileges)
become_method = sudo			(run sudo to escalate)
become_user = root				(user to escalate to)
become_ask_pass = true/false	(ask for a password (sshkeys) or configure sudo/ssh)

# This is a Comment so is ;
```

​			**Required**

​					Location of Inventory

​					Protocol (SSH by default)

​					remote user

​					Privileged / Unprivileged  suders file `<username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL`

​					Prompt for a password (ssh-copy-id)

#### Create and use static inventories to define groups of hosts **(see inventories above)**

#### Manage parallelism (learn more about this ***)

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_strategies.html#setting-the-number-of-forks

default ability to interact with multiple hosts at the same time.

forks [num]: set the number of forks

timeout [integer]: set the timeout of tasks in seconds (0 to disable)

fork: 10 

throttle: 15

at most 10 hosts will be operated on in parrallel



### Configure Ansible managed nodes

<a href="ex294.html">Top</a>

#### Create and distribute SSH keys to managed nodes

```
generate_ssh_key: yes
	name: user
	ssh_key_bits: 2048
	ssh_key_file: .ssh/id_rsa (default)

authorized_key
	user: username
    state: present
    key: "{{ lookup('file'), '/home/user1/.ssh/id_rsa.pub'  }}" 
```

#### Configure privilege escalation on managed nodes **(see configuration example above)**

You can define configuration settings within ad hoc commands

| Configuration   | Command-line option |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| become          | `-b`                |
| become_method   | `--become-method`   |
| become_user     | `--become-user`     |
| become_ask_pass | `-K`                |

#### Validate a working configuration using ad hoc Ansible command

| Error/Info                                  | Syntax                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Log files (ansible does not log by default) | in `ansible.cfg` locate `log_path =` need to have write perms for the directory |
| Debug module                                | prints out value for certain variables/facts to stdout       |
|                                             | debug:                                                       |
|                                             | msg: "the hostname {{ ansible_facts['fqdn'] }}"              |
| Manage Errors                               | `--syntax-check`                                             |
|                                             | `--step`  will step through the playbook                     |
|                                             | `--start-at-task="Start service"` start execution at a specific task |
| Debugging                                   | Check output of playbook recap                               |
| Checking mode                               | `--check` run smoke tests on a playbook                      |
| ping hosts                                  | `-m ping`  you can try `--become` as well at the end to check errors |



### Script administration tasks **(need hands on experience)**

<a href="ex294.html">Top</a>

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/script_module.html#ansible-collections-ansible-builtin-script-module

#### Create simple shell scripts

#### Create simple shell scripts that run ad hoc Ansible commands

`ansible.builtin.script: /local/script.sh` 



### Create Ansible plays and playbooks

#### Know how to work with commonly used Ansible modules **(see modules above, and playbooks for example)**

#### Use variables to retrieve the results of running a command

using `register` statements to capture the output of a command. when this is ran the debug module is used to dump the value of the install_result to the terminal

```
---
- name: Installs a package and prints the result
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install the package
       yum:
		 name: httpd
		 state: installed
	   register: install_result								(register value)
	   
	- debug: 										(debug shows variable on the screen)
	   var: install_result
```

#### Use conditionals to control play execution

execute tasks or plays when certain conditions are met using the `when` statement

```
---
 - name: Simple Boolean Task Demo
   hosts: all
   vars:
     run_my_task: true							(sets boolean)
   tasks:
    - name: httpd package is installed
      yum:
        name: httpd
        when: run_my_task						(when statment,since run_my_task is true it will run)
   
   
---
  - name: Demonstrate the "in" keyword       (ansible_distribution is a fact from gathering facts)
    hosts: all
    gather_facts: yes
    vars:
      supported_distros:					(setting up a list to check for RedHat or Fedora on remote host)
        - RedHat
        - Fedora
    tasks:
      - name: Install httpd using yum, where supported
        yum:
          name: httpd
          state: present
        when: ansible_distribution in supported_distros  
```

**Example Conditions**

| forcing execution of handlers after task failure             | force_handlers: yes    (set on play not task)                |
| specify task failure conditions (usually ran with command modules, based on command output) | failed_when: "'Failed message' in command_result.stdout"     |
| force a task failure with the `fail` module                  | fail:                                                        |
|                                                              | msg: "Fail message"                                          |

| Control when a task reports that has changed. if a certain output is collected notify to run handlers. use false to not get a changed result | changed_when:                                                |
| Block and Error Handling using `block`, `rescue` and `always` | block defines main tasks to run, rescue defines the tasks to run if block fails, always define tasks that run no matter what. |

#### Create playbooks to configure systems to a specified state

Most Ansible modules check whether the desired final state has already been achieved, and exit without performing any actions if that state has been achieved, so that repeating the task does not change the final state. 

For many modules, the ‘state’ parameter is optional. Different modules have different default settings for ‘state’, and some modules support several ‘state’ settings. Explicitly setting ‘state=present’ or ‘state=absent’ makes playbooks and roles clearer.

```
- name: Installs a package and prints the result
  hosts: all
  tasks:
	- name: Install the package
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: installed
```

List all modules installed on the system: `ansible-doc -l`  you can `| grep <search>` for specific modules

​	get information/docs on specific module: `ansible-doc <module>`

​	notice some modules include **OPTIONS (= is mandatory)**

​			`-a 'name=<name> uuid=2000 state=present'`

​			state checks the remote system for present or absent. check options for default `ansible-doc

### Work with roles

#### Role Structures

provides a way for you to make it easier to reuse ansible code generically.  you can package, in a standarized directory structure, all the tasks, variables, files, templates and other resources. 

list available roles

`subscription-manager refresh`

`subscription-manager repos --list | grep ansible`

Enable Ansible Engine

`subscription-manager repos --enable ansible-2-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms`

Install RHEL Roles and packages

`yum install rhel-system-roles ansible`

copy directory (package) from project to project

```
role.example/
├── defaults				(low precedence and are *intended to change* overwritten in plays)
│
└── main.yml				(default variables can be overwritten by inventory variables)

├── files					(contains static files that refrence by role tasks)
├── handlers				(the main.yml contains the roles handler definitions)
│
└── main.yml

├── meta					(main.yml contians info about the role, author, license, role dependencies)
│
└── main.yml
├── README.md

├── tasks					(main.yml contians role's tasks definition)
│
└── main.yml

├── templates				(Jinja2 templates)

├── tests					(contains test and inventory playbooks to test)
│
├── inventory
│
└── test.yml

└── vars					(main.yml file defines the roles variable values)
└── main.yml				(role variables high presedence and cannot be overwritten by inventory variables)
```

#### Using Ansible Roles in Playbooks

```
- hosts: host1.example.com
  roles:
  	- role1
  	- role2
  # ansible looks in files, templates, or tasks first
  
 - hosts: host2.example.com   		(set role variables)
   roles:
   	 - role: role1
   	   var1: val1
   	   
 #Roles can be added to a play using ordinary task
 
 - name: A task to include role2 here
   include_role: role2
```

Tasks are executed as orderd in the task list. 

You can add the following to control the order of execution:

- pre_tasks

- pre_task handlers

- roles

- tasks

- role handlers

- task_handlers

- post_tasks

- post_task handlers


#### Reusing Content with system roles

<a href="ex294.html">Top</a>

ansible roles have been provided with OS `rhel-system-roles` package

helps standardize configurations between different versions of RHEL

`rhel-system-roles.<role>`

​	Found on Ansible Galaxy

<u>Installing RHEL System Roles</u>

verify any roles are available

`ansible-galaxy list`

Install

`yum install rhel-system-roles`

Location:	`ls -l /usr/share/ansibe/roles`

<u>Documentation</u>

`/usr/share/doc/rhel-system-roles`

<u>Example</u>

```
- name: Time Synchronization Play
  hosts: servers
  vars:
    timesync_ntp_servers:
      - hostname: 0.rhel.pool.ntp.org
        iburst: yes
      - hostname: 1.rhel.pool.ntp.org
        iburst: yes
      - hostname: 2.rhel.pool.ntp.org
        iburst: yes
    timezone: UTC
    
  roles:
    - rhel-system-roles.timesync
  tasks:
    - name: Set timezone
      timezone:
      name: "{{ timezone }}"
```

#### Create roles

<a href="ex294.html">Top</a>

- Create the role directory
- define the role content
- use the role in the playbook

Default path: `~/.ansible/roles` : `/usr/share/ansible/roles` : `/etc/ansible/roles`

you could have your roles in home directory (~/.ansible/roles) and system can have roles installed for all users in /usr/share/ansible/roles

##### Skeleton

`ansible-galaxy init my_new_role_name`

##### Role Dependencies

meta/main.yml

```
---
  dependencies:
    - role: apache
      port: 8080
    - role: postgres
      dbname: serverlist
      admin_user: felix
```

##### Role Behavior with Variables

well written roles use default variables. 

values of any variable defined in a roles defaults directory will be overwritten if that same variable is 

- defined in the inventory

- Yaml file `group_vars` or `host_vars`

- nested in the vars keywork

  vars:

  ​	system_owner: someon@example.com

  roles:

  ​	- role: motd

- as a varialbe included the roles keyword in play.

#### Download roles from an Ansible Galaxy and use them

public library of ansible content. https://galaxy.ansible.com

​	has normal website functionality, search, filter, scoring, documentation

<u>Command Line</u>

​	`ansible-galaxy search '<name.role>' --platforms EL` 

​		EL - Enterprise Linux

​		--author, --platform, --galaxy-tags

​	`ansible-galaxy info <name.role>`

​	`ansible-galaxy install <name.role> -p roles/`

​		`-p` specifies directory to install 

​		`-r roles/requirements.yml` specify requirements in yml file

​		<u>3 Common requirements to use:</u>

```
		# from Ansible Galaxy, using the latest version
		- src: geerlingguy.redis
		
		# from Ansible Galaxy, overriding the name and using a specific version
		- src: geerlingguy.redis
		  version: "1.5.0"
		  name: redis_prod
		
		# supports 'http', 'https', or 'file' protocols share roles with others .tar
		- src: file:///opt/local/roles/myrole.tar
		  name: myrole
```

​	`ansible-galaxy list`  list roles

​	`ansible-galaxy remove <name.role>` remove roles



### Use advanced Ansible features

<a href="ex294.html">Top</a>

#### Create and use templates to create customized configuration files

#### Deploying custom files with Jinja2 templates

modules are used to modify existing files, a more powerful way to manage files is to template them.

Ansible uses Jinja2 to template files. 

Uses delimiters 

```
{# /etc/hosts line #}				(comment)
{{ ansible_facts['default_ipv4']['address']}} 	{{ ansible_facts['hostname']}} <EXPR>
```

#### Building Templates

Composed of data, variables, and expressions

use the `.j2` extention on templates. Set up on local control node and sent to remote hosts to modify files/configs

manage templates with `ansible_manage = Ansible managed` configured in ansible.cfg

<u>Deploy templates</u>

​		  template:

​					src: /j2-template.j2

​					dest: /dest-config-file.txt

<u>Jinja2 uses for statements to provide looping functionality</u>

​		{% for user in users %}

​				{{ user }}

​		{% endfor %}

<u>Jinja2 uses if statements to provide conditional control</u>

​		{% if finished %}

​		{{ result }}

​		{% endif %}

<u>Example</u> (modify the motd file on remote hosts) (playbook implementing template also shown)

```
#Template motd.j2 file system_owner is defined in the playbook, the rest are facts

This is the system {{ ansible_facts['fqdn'] }}.
This is a {{ ansible_facts['distribution'] }} version {{ ansible_facts['distribution_version'] }} system.
Only use this system with permission.
Please report issues to: {{ system_owner }}.

#Playbook Implentation

---
	- name: configure SOE
	  hosts: all
	  remote_user: devops
	  become: true
	  vars:
		- system_owner: clyde@example.com
	  tasks:
		- name: configure /etc/motd
		template:
			src: motd.j2
			dest: /etc/motd
			owner: root
			group: root
			mode: 0644
```

#### Use Ansible Vault in playbooks to protect sensitive data

##### Ansible Vault

<a href="ex294.html">Top</a>

Can be used to encrypt and decrypt and structured data file used by Ansible

| Command                                          | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ansible-vault`                                  | create, edit, encrypyt, decrypt, and view files              |
| `ansible-vault create <name>.yml`                | prompts for a password , you can store password and it will be encrypted. |
| `ansible-vault view <name>.yml`                  | view encrypted file (prompted for password)                  |
| `echo <password> > vault-pass`                   | setup a password for ansible vault                           |
|                                                  | requires `chmod 0600 vault-pass`                             |
| `ansible-vault edit <name>.yml`                  | edit vault file                                              |
| `ansible-vault encrypt <name>.yml `              | encrypt single or multiple files                             |
| `ansible-vault decrypt <name>.yml`               | decrypt a single or multiple file                            |
| `--output=<name>.yml`                            | after a decrypt or encrypt change the name                   |
| `ansible-vault rekey <name>.yml`                 | change password on a file                                    |
| `ansible-playbook --vault-id @prompt <name>.yml` | vault playbook implementation                                |
|                                                  | `--ask-vault-pass`  Ansible versions earlier than 2.4 **(use this)** |
| `--vault-password-file=vault-pass`               | specify password file instead of prompting for a password    |

you can add <vault name> to your `host_vars` and `group_vars` to manage groups and hosts with ansible vault
